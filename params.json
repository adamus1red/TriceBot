It allows users to authenticate using their credentials on-site and thus be authorised for official channels on IRC.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n=========\r\n\r\nTrice is fast, secure, reliable and stable. It is written in perl and utilizes the POE::Component::IRC framework. It has a plugin system which allows admins to load/unload plugins on the fly without the need to restart the bot. It also has a logging system with error reporting.\r\n\r\nRequriements\r\n============\r\n\r\nTrice uses perl with some perl modules.\r\n\r\nDebian/Ubuntu\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n`apt-get install perl libpoe-component-irc-perl libpoe-component-pluggable-perl libwww-perl libconfig-simple-perl libmodule-refresh-perl libwww-mechanize-perl libnet-dns-perl libgeo-ip-perl libdate-pcalc-perl liblog-log4perl-perl libclass-unload-perl`\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n---------\r\n\r\nYou can download an archive or checkout the latest stable revision from GIT.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n===========\r\n\r\nThe bot requires bot.cfg to be in its folder.
